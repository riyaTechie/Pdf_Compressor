# Pdf_Compressor
A Python-based tool to compress PDF files by resizing and compressing pages rendered as images. This script reduces the file size of PDFs while maintaining a balance between quality and storage efficiency. The project leverages libraries like PyMuPDF, Pillow, and PyPDF2 for robust PDF and image handling.

You can execute the script using any Python environment, such as:

IDLE: Launch the script directly by opening it in IDLE and pressing F5.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-compression-tool.git
cd pdf-compression-tool
Run the script:
python compress_pdf.py

A file dialog will prompt you to select PDF files to compress.
The compressed PDFs will be saved with _compressed in their filenames.
